When several of these are in physical contact with each other and only each other, they will instinctively link up and evenly distribute any collected ejaculate amongst the swarm, slowly leeching energy from the ejaculate's alchemical charge, forming braided rings of continuous flow. If uninterrupted, these braided rings can sometimes form useful structures.

The Autonomous Tentacle is an unintelligent orgasmophage that will, left to its own devices, mindlessly seek to extract semen from phallic genitals and deposit that semen in yonic genitals, preferably at the same time.

You may give one of your _Autonomous Tentacles_ a mental command by succeeding at a **DC 8 Moxie Check**. You must roll a **Moxie Check** for every individual action you order your tentacle-spawn to perform during an Encounter, but one Check can cover a complex order while outside of an Encounter.

In an Encounter, __only the first order you give is free__. The second order costs **1 Stamina**, the third order costs **2 Stamina**, the fourth order costs **3 Stamina**, and so on. The Stamina cost is paid even if you fail the Moxie Check. After ending an Encounter, this cost resets.

There is no hard limit on how many _Autonomous Tentacles_ you may have, but the emergent consequences of having a lot of _Autonomous Tentacles_ following you around are what they are."""

- Any Organ that is Medium can fit in Medium and Large Sockets.

Determining the size of an Organ bends to the narrative and what makes physical sense therein, but in general:
- Mouths, Arms, and Genitals are Small.
- Breasts are Medium.
- Legs are Large.
- Additional Hips/Butts are larger than Large and thus too Large to attach to any of your Sockets.

__Face Socket:__

You are not limited to Small Organs on your face.

However, if you attach a Medium Organ to your face Socket, you lose the ability to breathe and must have some kind of narrative justification for why you can remain conscious. Suffocation is not deadly, in the Starheart Lodge, but it _is_ usually entirely incapacitating.

If you attach a Large Organ to your face Socket, you lose both the ability to breathe and the ability to see. There are no mechanical rules for blindness, but narratively you do not have eyes.

Your total number of "Prehensile" Appendages is equal to your Morph Capacity. While this number must remain constant, you may, during your turn, freely vary which "Prehensile" Organ these Appendages belong to. When you alter a Paired "Prehensile" Appendage in this way, its new form must also have a compatible Pairing Attribute, in at least one direction, to maintain a Pairing.

When you use a "Prehensile" Organ to use a Move, if that Organ has multiple valid Pairings between its Appendages and the target's Appendages available, the Stimulation dealt is replicated across all valid Pairings instead of divided between them or delivered to one alone. This causes you, by having multiple Appendages paired, to multiply the Stimulation dealt to one target, or deal Stimulation to multiple targets simultaneously, at no added Stamina cost. The Reciprocal Stimulation you receive is based on the sum of all Stimulation dealt, but is still capped by your Organ's Erogeny.

All Moves used by your "Prehensile" Organs gain the ability to inflict a stack of the Ahegao effect. A stack of the Ahegao effect is inflicted if:
- The target of the Move is already Having An Orgasm and the turn in which they started that Orgasm is already ended.
- The target of the Move already has an amount of Intensity Points that is greater than their base Sanity Score.
- Your Level Bonus is not less than the number of Ahegao stacks the target already has. (Additional-stack infliction limit is equal to your Level Bonus.)"""
